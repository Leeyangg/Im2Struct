##  Guide:

Our current release has been tested on Matlab 2015b

#### 1. Download and compile MatConvNet(http://www.vlfeat.org/matconvnet/)
	run matlab/vl_setupnn;   

	vl_compilenn('enableGpu', true, ... 
		     'cudaRoot', '/Developer/NVIDIA/CUDA-X.X', ... 
		     'cudaMethod', 'nvcc');

 
#### 2. Download our pre-trained model

Please download the pre-trained model according to the description in model/download.txt.

#### 3. Run im2struct_demo.m
Run im2struct_demo.m to recover 3D shape structure from an single RGB image with our pre-trained model. The recovered 3D shape structures can be visulized in Matlab.

The recovered 3D shape structures for example images(data/example_1/2/3.jpg) should look as follows:
