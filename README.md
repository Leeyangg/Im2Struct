##  Guide:

Our current release has been tested on Matlab

#### 1. Download and compile MatConvNet(http://www.vlfeat.org/matconvnet/)
	run matlab/vl_setupnn;   

	vl_compilenn('enableGpu', true, ... 
		     'cudaRoot', '/Developer/NVIDIA/CUDA-X.X', ... 
		     'cudaMethod', 'nvcc');

 
#### 2. Download our pre-trained model

#### 3. run im2struct_demo.m
Use im2struct_demo.m to generate 3D shape structure based on trained model. The input is an image, the output of 3D shape structure is showed in figure.
